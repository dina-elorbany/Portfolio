# [Dina Elorbany's Portfolio](https://dina-elorbany.netlify.app/)


I've used and learned many beneficial technologies, which was an excellent experience for me.

## TOOLS:
- HTML
- CSS3
- Sass
- JavaScript
- React JS
- MaterialUI
- Framer Motion
- Sanity CMS
- GitHub
- Netlify.

### Details:
I used:-
- Sanity as a CMS to easily create schemas and dynamically upload new features like works, certificates, testimonials or whatever I want to the portfoio.
- MaterialUi with tooltip and useMediaQuery for creating and stylying the popup section which contains each experience details.
- Framer Motion for nicely animate sections and elements.
- Netlify linked to github for deploying the final version and keep it always and automatically up to date, the .env file was the reason for an issue in the deployment but it solved with the CI= npm run build command.
